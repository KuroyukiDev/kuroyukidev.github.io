<h1> ABOUT US</h1>


<h2></b>Motor Skills for all levels </b></h2>
<p>Since 1983 this school has been teaching, and giving all
drivers the opportunity to learn and develope the new skills and
reflexes required for immediate response to vehicle loss of
control for whatever reason, on any surface, at any time.</p>

<p>&quot;Vehicles don't lose control&quot; - drivers lose
control . This never occours with out some type of warning to the
driver, loss of traction is a gradual, altho alarming sensation.
All drivers should be able to predict and detect when they are
beginning to lose traction.</p>

<p>Even the perfect driver will at some time find themself in
a new, unfamiliar, terrifying situation that they most likely did
not initiate. Typically in these situations the driver has
approxinatly 1/4 of a second to Sense - Identify- Predict -
Decide and Execute the appropriate actions to maintain control of
their vehicle. The inability to do this through lack of knowledge
and skill results in unnecessary vehicle damage, human injury and
death every day on our roads and highways,this can be
reduced.</p>
