<h1>Student Information</h1>
		
<h2>Driving Basics and Lessons: </h2>
	<p>To start the day, we begin with 1 - 1.5 hr. of classroom, explaining basic vehicle 
	dynamics & physics when applied to steering control & braking .</p>

	<p>Drivers are taught that all skids begin with a slide. If sensed early enough and properly 
	handled, you can prevent a slide from developing into a skid." Slides are controllable."</p>

    <h1>Post-Traumatic Rehab</h1>
     
		<p>In many cases, drivers or passengers in vehicles involved in
		serious collisions, may suffer a lasting psychological effect
		reducing the ability of the person to operate a vehicle to some
		degree or in severe cases, not at all.. We have had success in
		working with medical doctors their patient to regain confidence
		behind the wheel and return to a productive and full-filling
		lifestyle.</p>

		<p>If the patient has a lasting effect, their
		knowledge/understanding of the situation will make them more
		comfortable and confident. They will also realize what type of
		situations may be best for them to avoid. </p>

	
	<h1>New driver handling</h1>


		<p>We feel that there is enough stress in
		driver training (trying to learn the rules of the road and how to
		deal with traffic) without having to figure out how to operate the
		vehicle at the same time.</p>
 
		<p>We teach the new vehicle operator to be totally comfortable
		and confident with vehicle operation. All vehicle operation
		should be second nature combined with reflex response.</p>

		<p>Upon completion of our program the new vehicle operator will be
		reacting rather than wondering what they should be doing in a
		given situation or how the vehicle will respond to driver
		actions.</p>

    <h1>Senior Skill Development</h1>

		<p>Like it or not, age effects us. Physically and mentally for
		different reasons we slow down and become restricted in our
		abilities.</p>

		<p>This a way of life that we have to accept, it is much easer to
		deal with when we realize our limits and then adapt to stay
		within them. Most problems occur when any driver, typically
		unknowingly pushes themselves or their vehicle beyond acceptable
		limits. This is usually covered after by the familiar &quot;
		there was nothing I could do ! &quot;</p>
	
<h1> Weather Conditions</h1>
	<p>Due to uncontrollable winter weather, we deal differently with winter training.</p>

	<p>The bottom line is that we want drivers to realize that all surfaces are dangerous, not only 
	when they are wet or covered with snow and ice.</p>

	<p>The training and techniques will and do work on any surface in any vehicle if the driver can 
	properly judge the surface traction.</p> 

	<p>We walk with the same skills winter or summer, how do you adjust your walking skills differently for 
	the different seasons? Most don't, but they adapt the same skills to more slippery surfaces.</p>
