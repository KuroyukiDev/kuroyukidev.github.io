<h1>Mission</h1>

	<p>
	Our Mission is to make "good" drivers, "safer" drivers! 
	We offer four different courses that guarantee you become a safer
	driver.
	</p>
	<p>Over time the human and vehicle damage in our society has grown to
	accept as a part of daily life, and the cost of being on
	our roads can be effectively reduced not eliminated.
	</p>




	<h1>Response Time</h1>

		<p>What we experience in our daily lives is the result of vehicle
		operators finding themselves in unfamiliar life and death
		situations with 1/4 of a second to respond and face the
		consequences and not knowing what to do, and what to do next.
		</p> 
		<p>
		(similar to dropping a piece of fine china and not knowing how to
		catch it. ).
		</p>

										<!-- Omitted
										<h1>Tax dollars</h1>
										<p>If the result of all vehicle collisions in the past year had
										been reduced by 10 %, how many dollars would have ben saved in
										our health care system alone ? Not to mention what might have
										been saved in other areas as well.(human suffering, lost work
										time, insurance rates, )</p> -->

	<h3>Self Confidence</h3>
		<p>No training system can ever make anyone perfect, BUT out
		program WILL improve any vehicle operators skills and confidence
		far beyond 10 %. We Guarantee it !!</p>

		<p>Our training is not designed to replace any other driver
		training system only to supplement them. </p>

		<p>Our training is not designed to and will not teach you how to
		drive or pass a drivers examination or test.</p>

		<p>Our training is specially developed to teach and improve your
		VEHICLE HANDLING SKILLS in unfamiliar ( scarry ) situations, as
		well as routine operation of any vehicle in any conditions.</p>

		<p>Our system will and has been proven to work in any vehicle
		(front - rear wheel drive, standard - automatic transmission, sub
		compact - trucks/bus)</p>


	<h3>Real Life Situations</h3>

		<p>Our School will not and does not test or examine
		you! We only TEACH and provide you with the opportunity to
		discover what you are capable of and where your limits are,
		better than finding out when you are behind the wheel in a real
		situation.</p>

		<p>We teach in a safe environment, low speed - very
		slippery surface. The instructor is always in the car. We do not
		damage our cars, but our students only get approximatly 300 miles
		out of our tires, this is not a simulator, only a safe learning
		experience.</p>

										<!-- Omitted
										<h2><strong>PROVINCIAL COURT TRAFFIC TICKET REDUCTION</strong>:</h2>

										<p>In 1996, after much effort, communication, correspondance and
										a referal from the Ottawa Carleton Safety Council, we persuaded a
										Crown Attorney to use our program as a trial / pilot effort. We
										felt that our program would do more towards educating drivers and
										making our roads safer than the typical system of imposing fines
										and licence suspensions. </p>

										<p>Since then an on-going relationship has been developed with
										other Crown Attornies, P.O.I.N.T.T.S and S.T.O.P.P. (Traffic
										Ticket Specialists) in the area, we are all working together with
										a common goal, to accept the fact that no-one will ever eliminate
										Vehicle Collisions, but with a combined effort the number of, and
										severity of collisions can be <strong>Reduced </strong>! with
										further education, including practical experience. </p> -->


    
    <h1>Post-Traumatic Rehab</h1>
     


		<p>In many cases, drivers or passengers in vehicles involved in
		serious collisions, may suffer a lasting psychological effect
		reducing the ability of the person to operate a vehicle to some
		degree or in severe cases, not at all.. We have had success in
		working with medical doctors their patient to regain confidence
		behind the wheel and return to a productive and ful-filling
		lifestyle.</p>

		<p>If the patient has a lasting effect, their
		knowledge/understanding of the situation will make them more
		comfortable and confident. They will also realize what type of
		situations may be best for them to avoid. </p>

	
	<h1>New driver handling</h1>


		<p>We feel along with others that there is enough stress in
		driver training trying to learn the rules of the road and how to
		deal with traffic without having to figure out how to operate the
		vehicle at the same time.</p>
 
		<p>We teach the new vehicle operator to be totally comfortable
		and confident with vehicle operation. All vehicle operation
		should be second nature combined with reflex response. In an
		emergency situation, thinking requires valuable time and space,
		which is usually not available.</p>

		<p>Upon completion of our progam the new vehicle operator will be
		reacting rather than wondering what they should be doing in a
		given situation or how the vehicle will respond to driver
		actions.</p>

		<p>Driver instructors and examiners can and will notice the
		difference in drivers with these skills and drivers without.</p>

		<p>Learning to drive with out these basic skills is comparable to
		attempting to play hockey without being able to skate. </p>


    <h1>Senior Skill Development</h1>

		<p>Like it or not, age effects us. Physically and mentally for
		different reasons we slow down and become restricted in our
		abilities.</p>

		<p>This a way of life that we have to accept, it is much easer to
		deal with when we realize our limits and then adapt to stay
		within them. Most problems occour when any driver, typically
		unknowlingly pushes themself or their vehicle beyond acceptable
		limits. This is usually covered after by the familiar &quot;
		there was nothing I could do ! </p>

		<p>We do not believe in testing drivers, we want to find out and
		show them how good they are. Then we use that as a starting point
		to build on for further improvement. Once again, we believe that
		humans learn much better in a positive environment. We want
		drivers to feel good about their driving skills, become more
		confident and make our roads safer for everyone.</p>
